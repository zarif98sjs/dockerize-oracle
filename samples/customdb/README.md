Example of creating a custom database
=============================================
Once you have built your image you can create a database with a custom name by passing on two environment variables.

# How to start the container
First make sure you have built **oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee** (you can substitue with the image of your choice).  
Now start the container as follow:

	docker run --name <container name> \
	-p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
	-e ORACLE_SID=<your SID> \
	-e ORACLE_PDB=<your PDB name> \
	-v <host mount point>:/opt/oracle/oradata
	oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee

Following parameters are passed on:

    --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
    -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port. Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 5500 (OEM Express)
    -e ORACLE_SID: The Oracle Database SID that should be used (default: ORCLCDB)
    -e ORACLE_PDB: The Oracle Database PDB name that should be used (default: ORCLPDB1)
    -v             The data volume to use for the database. Has to be owned by the Unix user "oracle" or set appropriately. If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.

After the container is up and running you can connect to the new database.
Remember that the database uses an automatically generated password for the admin accounts.
If you want to change the password refer to [Changing the admin accounts passwords](https://github.com/gvenzl/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase#changing-the-admin-accounts-passwords):

	sql system/<your new db password>@//localhost:1521/<your new SID/PDB name>

The above scenario from this sample will give you a new custom database within the Oracle Database Docker image.
